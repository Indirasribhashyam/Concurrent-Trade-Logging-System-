# Concurrent-Trade-Logging-System-
This project simulates a simplified financial trading system where trades pass through four sequential stages like Order Placed, Validated, Executed, and Settled. The system is designed to handle multiple trades concurrently using raw threads, ensuring that events for each trade are logged in the proper order even when processed simultaneously.
